__Errors__
Browser.php;
(406) Not Acceptable! This error relates to the filename entered for creating a file/folder with a problematic name. Filters have processed that the file name has "illegal" characters. Filters can be added/removed in the function "filterString()".

__Bugs__
(/var/www/turtlenas/private/PHP/handle-downloads.php)
+ Downloading "hidden/dotfiles" through a browser will append the filename if starting with a (.) dot. (Example: ".bashrc" --href--> "bashrc"). Uploading and backing up these files is fine otherwise, however if you download a hidden file, it is recommended doing so by using the "Zip Download", or the "Encrypted Download" button.

Problem could be due to nginx, or modern browser design appending it automatically. Unsure how to fix.

__File Upload Limits__
(/etc/nginx.conf)
+ Contains a hardcap filesize limit for what can be uploaded to the server. "client_max_body_size 1000G;"
+ Contains a bandwidth limit nginx. "limit_rate 5m;"

(/etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini) 
+ Contains a hardcap filesize limit for what can be uploaded to the server. "max_file_uploads;", "upload_max_filesize;", "post_max_size;", "max_file_uploads;"

+ After this number of seconds, stored data will be seen as 'garbage' and cleaned up by the garbage collection process. "session.gc_maxlifetime = 43200"

(/etc/sites-available/turtlenas-config)

+ Contains a read timeout for cgi. Determines time spent running a PHP script before timing out (causes a 504). ""
